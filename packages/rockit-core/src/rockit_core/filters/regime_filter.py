"""
Regime Filter -- Bull/Bear regime detection and directional gating.

The data period (Nov 2025 - Feb 2026) was:
  - Net: -0.9% (slightly bearish)
  - 50/50 up/down days
  - 39% bull regime (EMA20 > EMA50), 61% bear regime

PROBLEM SOLVED:
  - Short strategies showed 17-30% WR because we applied them in ALL regimes
  - Long strategies showed 57-80% WR for same reason (bull-regime trades dominated)
  - SOLUTION: Only trade LONGS in bull regime, SHORTS in bear regime
  - This should unlock short strategies in bear periods without hurting long WR

REGIME DETECTION (3 methods, AND logic):
  1. EMA20 vs EMA50 at session open (HTF trend)
  2. Prior session close vs VWAP (institutional bias)
  3. Price vs prior day close (gap direction)

When regime is BULL:
  - LONG signals: PASS (full size)
  - SHORT signals: BLOCK (or reduce to 50% size)

When regime is BEAR:
  - SHORT signals: PASS (full size)
  - LONG signals: BLOCK (or reduce to 50% size)

When regime is NEUTRAL/CHOP:
  - Both directions: reduce to 50% size
