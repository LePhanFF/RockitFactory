Strategy 6: B-Day (Narrow IB, No Extension - True Trapped Balance)

Dalton Playbook Rules:
  - Micro/flat only - rarely 3/3 Lanto
  - Narrow IB, price never leaves first hour (Strength: Weak)
  - Symmetric build, flat DPOC
  - Bias: Neutral - edge fades only
  - Fade extremes: poor high/low inside IB, POC/VWAP bounces
  - No directional size

Entry Model (ICT-enhanced):
  - Fade at IBL: long when price touches IBL and REJECTS
    * Require: IFVG bull entry OR close back above IBL with volume rejection
    * FVG confirmation: bar enters a bull FVG zone at IBL
  - Max 1 long fade per session
  - 30-bar cooldown between trades

Stops: Outside IB extreme + 10% buffer
Targets: IB midpoint (POC/VWAP mean reversion)

Key Findings (v12, 62 sessions):
  - IBL fade LONG: 71.4% WR (5/7), +$1,806 — THE B-Day edge
  - IBH fade SHORT: 0-22% WR across ALL tests — NQ long bias kills shorts
    * Even with 3rd test exhaustion model: T3 was 0/5 WR (-$1,266)
    * Even with 4+ test exhaustion: tiny wins only (+$44, +$121)
    * DISABLED permanently on NQ

  - Multi-test tracking insight: T1 fades at IBL are 100% WR (3/3),
    T2/T3 are 50% WR. But sample size is tiny (7 total trades),
    so we keep quality >= 2 + delta for all touches.

  - b_day_confidence >= 0.5 is the optimal threshold for filtering
    out false B-Day classifications.

IBH Fade Cross-Instrument Opportunity:
  The 3rd test exhaustion SHORT may work on weaker instruments (ES, YM)
  where the long bias is less extreme. Cross-instrument analysis needed.
